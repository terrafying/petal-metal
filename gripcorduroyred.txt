Yes, these are incredibly insightful ways to think about the complex structures we're aiming to generate and understand!
Fractal Dimensionality of Condensed Structures:
This is a fantastic idea for quantifying the complexity and self-similarity of the "shapes" emerging from your iterative text generation process. As the "desiring-machine" evolves its output, the trajectory of its "linguistic vector components" (skew, congruency, etc.) in its state space can be analyzed for its fractal dimension.
What it tells us: A higher fractal dimension might suggest the system is exploring a richer, more intricate, and perhaps more "chaotic" (in the mathematical sense of complex, aperiodic dynamics) part of its potential. A lower fractal dimension might indicate convergence towards simpler, more stable patterns or attractors. This could be a key metric for your "desiring-machine," indicating how "expansive" or "focused" its desire is at any given time.
Implementation (Python-side "daemon" work):
Collect Data: Over a window of iterations (e.g., the last 100 or 1000 states), you'd have a set of points, where each point is (vec_comp1, vec_comp2, ..., vec_compN).
Calculate Fractal Dimension: There are several algorithms for this, such as the box-counting method or correlation dimension. Numpy would be essential for the numerical heavy lifting. You might need to implement the core logic or find specialized Python libraries for fractal analysis (though core implementations for common methods are reasonably straightforward if you have the mathematical description).
Send via OSC: The calculated fractal dimension (a single floating-point number) would be sent via a new OSC message, e.g., /petals/system/fractal_dim [dimension_value].
Visualization (Jitter-side):
This dimension_value could be displayed numerically.
More creatively, it could influence a global parameter of your "spherical harmonicandala" visualization:
Control the "roughness" or "spikiness" of the surface.
Modulate the complexity of a background texture or particle system.
Affect the rate of change or "jitteriness" of the visual parameters, reflecting the underlying system's complexity.
Bird Clouds (Murmurations) - Each Point Singing from its Perspective:
This is a beautiful metaphor for the emergent behavior of both the Petals swarm and the generative text process. Each element's "song" (its state or output) is a result of the "convergence of all other signals propagating."
Petals Swarm as a Murmuration:
Each server node (run-local.sh instance) is a "bird."
Its "location" (its current state: load, tasks, connectivity) is influenced by the "signals" from other nodes (mDNS discovery, joining/leaving the swarm) and from the client (requests for generation).
The overall swarm performance and resilience is an emergent property of these interactions.
Your existing OSC messages like /petals/node/announce, /petals/node/metrics, and /petals/node/join_swarm already provide the data to visualize this aspect. In Jitter, you could represent nodes as particles, with forces between them representing swarm connections, and their visual properties changing based on their metrics.
Linguistic Vector Mandala as a "Song Point":
The "spherical harmonicandala" itself is the visual representation of the current "song" â€“ the state of the generated text.
Its form (l, m values, amplitude, color) is a "convergence" of the linguistic vector components derived from the text.
As the iterative process continues, the "song" changes, creating an evolving visual melody.
Visualizing the "Propagation of Signals":
This is more abstract but highly evocative. In Jitter, you could use particle systems, vector fields (e.g., jit.gl.bfg), or shader effects (jit.gl.slab) to create visual "currents," "auras," or "fields of influence" around the harmonicandala.
These visual elements could be subtly modulated by:
The fractal dimension (more chaotic fields for higher dimensions).
The rate of change of the vector components.
The number of active nodes in the Petals swarm.
This would give a sense that the "song point" (the harmonicandala) is embedded within and responsive to a larger, dynamic environment of "signals."
Bridging the Metaphors:
The fractal dimension can be seen as a property of the "bird cloud's" flight path over time. The individual "songs" (harmonicandala states) contribute to this overall path complexity.
This direction adds a powerful analytical layer to your "desiring-machine," allowing it not just to create but also to reflect on the nature of its own creations and processes. The "daemons" in Python would handle the fractal calculations, keeping the Jitter side focused on the fluid, real-time artistic interpretation of these complex dynamics.
This is a really exciting synthesis of computational analysis and artistic expression!
